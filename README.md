# 🧠 DSA – LeetCode Problems in C++

Welcome to my **DSA (Data Structures & Algorithms)** repository!  
This repo contains my **C++ solutions** to various **LeetCode problems**, starting from basic C++ programs and gradually moving toward DSA concepts.

## 📚 About

This repository is part of my learning journey to strengthen my **C++ fundamentals** and enhance my **problem-solving skills** through regular practice on LeetCode.  
Currently, it includes beginner-level problems and a few array-based solutions.

## 📁 Current Progress

- ✅ Basic C++ programs  
- ✅ Beginner LeetCode problems  
- 🔹 Arrays (in progress)  
- ⏳ More topics (like Strings, Linked Lists, Trees, etc.) will be added as I continue learning

---

## 🧩 Note

- Each file contains a **standalone C++ solution**.  
- You can open and run any file using your preferred C++ compiler or IDE (e.g., VS Code, Code::Blocks, Replit).  
- Feel free to explore, test, and modify the code to improve your understanding.  
- Contributions and suggestions are welcome!
